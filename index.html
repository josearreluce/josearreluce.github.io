		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> Hey there! I'm a third year student at the University of Chicago majoring in Computer Science. I one day hope to be a software engineer, or something like that.
		    I'm working on this website as a way of developing my skills and also because I think it's a fun side project to work on during my last month before
		    school. It may look ugly now, but hopefully I'll be able to make it somewhat presentable in the near future. Please stay tuned.
